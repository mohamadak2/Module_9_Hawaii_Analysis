# Module_9_Hawaii_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis
The idea for this analysis was to review how the tempertures was for specifed months. 
Then Provide some basic information about the month such as:
-Count
-Mean (Average)
-Standard Deviation
-Minimum
-Max

### Results

We were able to provide this analysis for 2 months.

June Month:

### Summary

Over all we wanted to pick two extreme months. This case we wanted to pick a really hot month (June) versus a really cold month (December).

The month of june seems to be on average 74.94 degress Fahrenheit which is around 3 degrees hotter than December 71.04 Fahrenheit.
My thoughts are the temeperature doesn't have much varience throught the year.

If I wanted to improve on this anaylsis, I would provide a Month to Month analysis where I run a query for each month and create a Summary for each month.
Then I would be able to create a line plot that would show the transition of temperature through the months.
This way we can get a better idea on temerature on a yearly basis.
